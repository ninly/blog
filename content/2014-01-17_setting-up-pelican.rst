Setting up Pelican
==================

So here it is, a blog, live and loaded with some content! Like magic.

I will not go into much detail here about the setup of this site or how
I got here, but a few resources did help me quite a bit along the way.
Among them (and I've probably missed a one or two):

* `Pelican itself`_, of course

* `Duncan Lock`_, whose post got me down the road a good long way -- but
  who still owes us a Part 2!

* `Terri Yu`_, whose post also helped me muck through the pelican setup

* `How to use Pelican on GitHub Pages`_, by Josef Jezek, with additional
  details about ghp-import in `these tips`_ from the Pelican docs

* `Dedi Purwanto`_, mostly for the theme_, but nice blog, too :)

In practice, the real work had more to do with deciding how to host
and organize my content, and recommendations are thin for that sort
of thing. That seems appropriate to a static-site generator such as
pelican. The whole point: you do it however you want. It's not *that*
hard, after all.

As such, assuming this project sticks around awhile, it will probably
be a casual work in progress for some time. Since what I'm after is
a simple dumping ground for ideas, development progress, and makery
learnings, I hope to remain focused more on content and ideas, rather
than packaging and presentation (except insofar as these constitute
makery learnings). But do contact me if you have any recommendations
or notice something I've obviously overlooked.

A few honorable mentions and bookmarks: blog posts and articles about
pelican, static-site generators, and devblogging in general that I
didn't use explicitly when initially setting up this site, but which
I've come across and expect to come back to:

* Helder Correira's `From Wordpress to Pelican`_

* Geoff Gimse's intriguingly titled `Text and Hubris`_ (several posts,
  but the `pelican-tagged articles`_ are a place to start)
